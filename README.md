# rubyred.rb

post to redmatrix (see https://redmatrix.me ) with vim and ruby from the command line.

place this in your path (perhaps ~/bin/rubyred.rb )

You MUST change the values for REDUSER, REDPASS, and REDURL
to your red username (e-mail associated with your account,
red password, and the url of your redmatrix hub, respectively.

requires
* vim (you COULD change the editor to nano or emacs or whatever, if you like, but why?
* ruby (tempfile, uri, net/http, json)

Script has only been successfully tested on linux (debian, in fact,
but why would you use anything else?
